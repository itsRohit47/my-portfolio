All they have to do is fill out their information through a visual editor, pick a template and the website will be generated for them. The website will be hosted on DeveloperPortfol.io and the developers can share the link with potential employers. The website will have a custom domain, analytics, and more. The website will be built using Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, TailwindCSS, and more. Unlike other website builders, the intention of this product is to not only allow developers showcase thier projects but also to build a projects database, new developers can take inspirations from.",
